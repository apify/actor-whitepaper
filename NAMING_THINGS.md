# Naming of things

TODO: Mention how to write about and link actors. We need to pick:
- **Web Scraper** ([apify/web-scraper](https://apify.com/apify/web-scraper)).
- [**Web Scraper**](https://apify.com/apify/web-scraper) (`apify/web-scraper`).

Here are some ideas for renames:

| Current name | New name |
|---|---|
| Apify app (`my.apify.com`) | Apify Console  (`console.apify.com`) |
| Apify Store (`apify.com/store`) | We can remove the name, and talk about public actors, user profiles, datasets, key-value stores etc. (`apify.com/search`) |
| Apify Actors (platform) | Apify Compute |
