# Naming of things

TODO: Mention how to reference actors for the first time:

> Our new **Web Scraper** ([apify/web-scraper](https://apify.com/apify/web-scraper)) actor is great.
> Use Web Scraper to extract data.

NOTE: In the first mention, use bold font for actor name and put the link to the technical name.
Use the word actor! The subsequent mentions can use just the human-readable name. 


Here are some ideas for renames:

| Current name | New name |
|---|---|
| Apify app (`my.apify.com`) | Apify Console  (`console.apify.com`) |
| Apify Store (`apify.com/store`) | We can remove the name, and talk about public actors, user profiles, datasets, key-value stores etc. (`apify.com/search`) |
| Apify Actors (platform) | Apify Compute |
