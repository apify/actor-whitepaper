// TODO: Does this make sense??? What for??? Dataset is different than KV-store...
//  Maybe it would be useful that it would:
//  1) Check the new records have a correct content-type when storing them and fail otherwise
//  2) Somehow render the view differently???
// IMHO boths cases are quite weak, plus we'd need to allow multiple such schemas per KV-store (unlike KV-store),
// so I'd skip this.
