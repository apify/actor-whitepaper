# Request queue schema

TODO: later on

But in general I think that it might be useful for 2 things:
- ensuring what kind of URLs might be enqueued (certain domains or subdomains, ...)
- ensure that for example each requets has `userData.label`, i.e. schema of `userData` the same way as we enforce it for the Datasets
